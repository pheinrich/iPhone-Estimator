Zetamari Estimator
Copyright (c) 2009  Peter Heinrich

This is a functional first draft of a (highly specialized) iPhone application
dedicated to cost estimation for commissioned artwork.  It's highly special-
ized because of the nature of the estimates, which are based on attributes
specific to Zetamari art pieces, as well as more general extrinsic character-
istics such as the surface area of various parameterized shapes.

The app is the beginning of my iPhone development education (as illustrated by
the beginner Objective-C).  It's not good.  It works, but it's really more of
a proof-of-concept.
